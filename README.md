# License-plate-detection-in-image
A model involving image processing and ML based character recognition algorithms to detect a vehicles License plate.
Briefly includes 2 steps:
1. Apply appropriate image processing techniques (use OpenCV).
2. Apply character recognition algorithm to read the content from the processed image (use easyOCR).

Can go through all the steps thoroughly mentioned in project.ipynb to get a more clear idea.
